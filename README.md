# Coding Challenge Backend

Your challenge is to create a Node.js server to serve as the (backend) API.

In the end, you'll be able to send a POST request to this server with a JSON payload containing a URL and it will return important and relevant metadata from the site at the given URL, including the site name, title, description, keywords, and author.

Example:

```bash
# request
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://davidhartsough.com/"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/
# result
{"url":"https://davidhartsough.com","siteName":"David Hartsough","title":"David Hartsough","description":"David Hartsough is widely regarded as a happy human, drummer, developer, designer, wannabe psychologist/philosopher, and stuntman â€” more or less.","keywords":"david,hartsough,davidhartsough,human,drummer,developer,designer,psychologist,philosopher,stuntman","author":"David Hartsough"}
```

## Steps

1. [Implementation](#implementation)

### Implementation

(in any order you prefer)

- In `src/server.ts`, follow the instructions on lines 24-28 and 30.
- In `src/get-metadata.ts`, follow the instructions on lines 12-18 and 23.

For help, use the Jest tests in `src/get-metadata.test.ts`.

## Scripts

In the root project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### `yarn test`

Runs the Jest tests.

## Language

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

## Linting/Formatting

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - formatting

As you complete the challenge, you are encouraged to lint and format your code.

In the root project directory, you can run the following scripts:

```bash
yarn lint
```

Or, to let eslint try to fix your code according to the linter and formatter standards, run:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```
